# gophercises-sol

This repo contains my solutions to all the [gophercises](https://gophercises.com/) including all the bonuses problems. Each folder is named after the gophercise of the same name.  The folders contain Golang files and a readme on how to use them.   
*Note*: The repo will be continually updated as I solve more ~~problems~~ gophercises.
