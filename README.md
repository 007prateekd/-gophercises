# gophercises-sol

*Note: The repo will be continually updated as I solve more ~~exercises~~ gophercises.*

This repo contains my solutions to all the [gophercises](https://gophercises.com/) including all the bonuses problems. Of course, it wouldn't have been possible without the official [video solutions](https://courses.calhoun.io/courses/cor_gophercises) and [github repos](https://github.com/gophercises/) to take reference from. Each folder is named after the gophercise of the same name.  The folders contain Golang files and a readme on how to use them.
